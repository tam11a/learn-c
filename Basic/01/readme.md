### C program to perform input output of all basic data types

Write a C program to demonstrate input and output of all basic and derived types. How to use `scanf()` and `printf()` function perform input and output on primitive types in C programming.

| Type                   | Size (bytes)                  | Format Specifier |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------- |
| int                    | at least 2, usually 4         | %d, %i           |
| unsigned int           | at least 2, usually 4         | %u               |
| char                   | 1                             | %c               |
| signed char            | 1                             | %c               |
| unsigned char          | 1                             | %c               |
| float                  | 4                             | %f               |
| double                 | 8                             | %lf              |
| long double            | at least 10, usually 12 or 16 | %Lf              |
| short int              | 2 usually                     | %hd, %hi         |
| unsigned short int     | 2 usually                     | %hu              |
| long int               | at least 4, usually 8         | %ld, %li         |
| unsigned long int      | at least 4                    | %lu              |
| long long int          | at least 8                    | %lld, %lli       |
| unsigned long long int | at least 8                    | %llu             |
